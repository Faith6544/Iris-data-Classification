# Iris-data-Classification
This project explores the Iris dataset to predict flower species (setosa, versicolor, virginica) based on measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The workflow includes data loading, preprocessing, training a Random Forest classifier, evaluating model performance, and visualizing predictions.
